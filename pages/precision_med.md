## Overview

The Precision Medicine Unit embodies a new era in pediatric healthcare. 
This whitepaper presents our systematic approach.
It departs from the traditional project-based research model, adopting a continuous, structured workflow that ensures consistency, reliability, and reproducibility across all levels of operation.



## Why the PMU is unique

Unlike traditional projects that are often tailor-made and lack systematic continuity, the PMU operates on a foundation of consensus work methods and shared philosophies. Each element of our work—from data collection to result interpretation—is interconnected within a meticulously designed network, ensuring that each piece of data and every analytical step is traceable and under constant scrutiny for compliance and efficiency.

Unlike traditional research projects which often start from scratch, our unit operates on a model of systematic and structured workflow crucial for effective precision medicine. 
This method ensures that every element of our work - from data collection to clinical application - is interconnected and efficiently managed. 
Our approach allows us to maintain consistency across various projects, enhancing the reproducibility and reliability of our results. 
Each project within the unit is a continuation of an evolving system, which is documented and audited for compliance with the latest regulatory standards, particularly the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR).

## Why This Matters
The structured approach of our Precision Medicine Unit ensures that all processes, from genomic data analysis to clinical implementation, are not only compliant with regulatory frameworks but also optimised for adaptation to new challenges and innovations. 
This model is crucial so that every element of our work remains connected so that we can run on the basis of single-source management and everything-as-code.
