## How data is collected and stored
* The Swiss Personalised Health Network (SPHN): collects and hosts omic data that we will ultimately use
* Branch of SPHN: [Data Coordination Center (DCC)](https://sphn.ch/network/data-coordination-center/)
* DCC is also a part of [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)](https://www.sib.swiss/personalized-health-informatics)
* The data is to be stored and processed on [BioMedIT network](https://www.biomedit.ch)
* Our tenant on BioMedIT is called MOMIC and this is on the [sciCORE infrastructure](https://scicore.ch).
* The database structure requires Resource Description Framework [(RDF) Schema](https://www.biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn)

## Database concepts
The DCC is responsible for making research data suitable for database management. 
To do this they design the concepts.
Training [material available here](https://sphn.ch/training/), but is a DCC responsibility.

Several concepts for the types of data that we use alredy exist.
e.g. genetic data concepts.

We also assist in generating new omics-related concepts for future expansion. 
This page will be updated to summarise the progress as these new concepts are defined.
